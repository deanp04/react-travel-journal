            <h1>A Review of Middle Earth's most popular desitions - by Samwise Gamgee</h1>
            <p>In the <span className="color-yellow">Shire</span>, there's this cozy corner by Bag End where Mr. Frodo and I used to share stories under the stars, the night's breeze carrying the scent of pipeweed and dreams fulfilled.</p>
            <p>In <span className="color-yellow">Rivendell's</span> tranquil halls, I marveled at the Elven melodies that danced on the air, feeling a momentary respite from our perilous journey, as if the very streams whispered tales of courage.</p>
            <p>In the darkness of <span className="color-yellow">Mordor</span>, I carried Mr. Frodo when his strength faltered, and though the weight of the Ring was heavy, the memory of the Shire's green fields ignited a fire of determination that burned brighter than any shadow.</p>
